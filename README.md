## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox for layout and box-shadow for visual depth)
- Google Fonts (using Figtree as the font family)

### What I learned

- Implementing proper font families and weights using @import from Google Fonts.
- Creating a simple yet elegant layout using Flexbox.
- Adding hover effects and border-radius for smoother design.
- Setting up box-shadow to give the card a modern UI look.

### Continued development

- Incorporate CSS Grid for complex layouts to expand flexibility in responsive design.
- Explore animations for buttons or hover states to make interactions more dynamic.
